# Modern Methods in Computational Economics

## A Workshop in HCMC

### November 2016

#### [John Stachurski](http://johnstachurski.net/)

Economists are increasingly using modern open source computing environments
such as [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](http://julialang.org/).

This workshop will cover the basics of these modern programming
languages, and how you can use them for research and policy analysis in
economics.

We assume that participants know some economics but do not know Python.
The level of programming will be introductory.


### Instructions


*  Before coming, please install [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) on your laptop

    * Python + the main scientific libraries
    * Free from http://continuum.io/downloads
    * Choose the Python 3.5 version
    * Make it your default Python distribution

* Optionally, you might also like to install [Julia](http://julialang.org/downloads)

    * Follow instructions for your OS
    * Some extra info [here](http://julialang.org/downloads/platform.html) if you need it

Please be sure to bring your laptop to the workshop.  

Please make sure that you have wireless access.
