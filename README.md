# Modern Methods in Computational Economics

## A workshop in HCMC

### November 2016

Lecturer: [John Stachurski](http://johnstachurski.net/)

Support: [Matthew McKay](https://github.com/mmcky)

Economists are increasingly using modern open source computing environments
such as [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](http://julialang.org/).

This workshop will cover the basics of the Python programming language, and
how you can use it for research and policy analysis in economics.

We assume that participants know some economics but do not know Python.
The level of programming will be introductory.
